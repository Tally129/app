# Natural Medical Solutions — Wellness EMR / CRM

## Original Problem Statement
HIPAA-aligned wellness EMR for `natmedsol.com` (Natural Medical Solutions Wellness Center). Wellness office, **not** a medical practice. Single-tenant private app, not SaaS. Aesthetic adapted from medspa-concierge to NatMedSol's deep-green / parchment / gold palette.

## Personas
- **Client:** PWA-installable; schedule, intake, chart/labs/plan, secure messaging, billing. Sign in with **email or Google**.
- **Practitioner:** schedule (full EHR view), charts, telehealth (live SOAP sidebar + AI draft), messaging, treatments, time clock, analytics.
- **Staff:** front desk, POS, transactions, inventory (lots/expiry), time clock.
- **Admin:** all of the above + user mgmt, audit, CSV import, EOD reports, manual time-clock edits.

> **All roles sign in at `/login`** (no separate staff URL — the same form authenticates clients, practitioners, staff, and admins).

## What's Implemented (✅)
### Phase 1–7 — done
JWT+RBAC+MFA+audit, intake, SOAP, GridFS files, appointments+availability, reminders, treatment plan, invoices, symptom tracker + lab Recharts, secure messaging, all of Phase 4 ops (POS/Inventory/TimeClock/FrontDesk/Treatments/Transactions/ImportClients), Phase 5 (Analytics + PWA + Telehealth UI redesign + a11y), Phase 6 (EHR Add Patient wizard + Appointments tab + self-hosted WebRTC + Cash Drawer + N+1 fix), Phase 7 (WS auth hardening + ICE config + live SOAP sidebar + auto-draft + Claude SOAP + recurring appts + lots/expiration + push infra + commissions).

### Phase 8 — Push Triggers, Google SSO, Cleanup (May 5, 2026) ⭐ NEW
- **Push notification triggers** wired to:
  - Appointment 1-hour reminder — `_appointment_reminder_loop` runs every 5 min, idempotent via `reminder_sent_at` flag
  - Daily expiring-inventory ping — `_expiring_inventory_loop` (admins/staff)
  - New secure message — invoked from `messages.create` to other thread participants
  - Low-stock on POS sale — admins/staff get a push when stock crosses threshold
  - Visit started (telehealth in_session) — pings the client to join
- **Emergent-managed Google SSO** via `POST /api/auth/google/session` exchanging `X-Session-ID` for our internal JWT. New Google accounts auto-created with role `client` and a matching Clients row. Existing email matches are linked.
- **Removed commission feature entirely** (treatments here are not commission-based). Endpoints `PUT /api/treatments/{id}/commission` + `GET /api/reports/commissions` now 404. UI button + dialog removed from Treatments page.
- **Login UX fixes** — title now "Sign in" (was "Patient Portal Sign In"), subtitle "Clients, practitioners, staff, and admins all sign in here." so staff don't wonder where to log in.
- **Critical bug fix from tester** — `AppointmentStatus` Literal extended to include `scheduled`, `arrived`, `in_session`. Previously the EHR Start-visit button + visit-started push were dead code (Pydantic 422'd). Now functional.
- **PWA push subscribe flow** — `/app/frontend/src/lib/push.js` ensures every authenticated user is subscribed (best-effort, silent failure).

### Phase 9 — Dedicated Telehealth Hub & Staff Portal (May 5, 2026) ⭐ NEW
- **Dedicated `/staff-login`** — separate dark-themed sign-in for staff/practitioners/admins (still routes back to `/login` for clients). All four roles can sign in at either URL.
- **Telehealth Hub** at `/portal/{role}/telehealth` — single-purpose page with tabs for Upcoming · Active · History · Equipment test, plus an Instant-visit dialog (provider+ only). Stat cards for Active now / Starting within 1h / Upcoming total. STUN/TURN/Browser/Push diagnostics in Equipment tab.
- **Staff Dashboard** at `/portal/staff` — front-desk-first KPIs (In clinic, Walk-ins, Completed today, Revenue), quick check-in, POS, Up Next, Time Clock, Low-stock and Expiring rails.
- **Admin Telehealth nav link** added to admin sidebar Today group.
- **Idempotent staff seed** — `frontdesk@natmedsol.local` / `FrontDesk!2345` (role=staff) auto-seeded for QA.
- **InstantVisitDialog** now uses `useNavigate` (SPA route) instead of `window.location.href` so auth context survives.
- **Carry-over fixes**: AppointmentIn + AppointmentUpdate validated to accept `status="in_session"` on both POST and PUT (regression confirmed by iter7 testing agent).

### Phase 10 — Forms & Consents + UX cleanup (May 5, 2026) ⭐ NEW
- **HIPAA red banner removed** from every page (PortalLayout, StaffLogin, TelehealthVisit, Login).
- **"36 years in practice"** copy update on Home (was 29+).
- **Admin Overview StatCards now clickable** — Clients/Users/Visit notes/Files/Appt requests/Audit each route to a list page. Two new clinic-wide drill-downs added: `/portal/admin/notes` (AdminNotesList, with provider filter + name search) and `/portal/admin/files` (AdminFilesList).
- **Front Desk KPI cards (In clinic / Walk-ins / Completed) now act as filter toggles** — write `?filter=in_clinic|walk_in|checked_out` to URL, with a visible chip + clear button.
- **Forms & Consents** new feature (admin / practitioner / staff):
  - 3 built-in templates auto-seeded: Treatment Consent, HIPAA Notice, Photo & Likeness Release.
  - **AI Transcribe** PDF/DOCX/TXT → Claude 4.5 → editable form schema (uses `pypdf` + `python-docx` for text extraction, then strict-JSON prompt to Claude via Emergent LLM key).
  - **AI Generate** from a free-text prompt.
  - In-app form builder with text/textarea/email/phone/number/date/checkbox/radio/select/signature field types.
  - Search by title, filter by category, archive (toggle active), built-ins are soft-archive only.
  - **Soft-link send** → tokenized `/forms/respond/:token` URL the patient can open without logging in. Submitted forms appear in the Submissions tab. Auto-push notification to the linked client if they are a portal user.
  - Public `FormResponder.jsx` page renders the form with a touch/mouse signature pad and validates required fields before submit.
- **Backend endpoints (Phase 10)**: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/forms/templates`, `POST /api/forms/transcribe`, `POST /api/forms/generate`, `POST /api/forms/send`, `GET /api/forms/submissions`, `GET /api/forms/submissions/{id}`, `GET /api/public/forms/{token}`, `POST /api/public/forms/{token}/submit`, `GET /api/notes/all`.
- **New deps**: `pypdf`, `python-docx`, `lxml` (added to requirements.txt).

### Phase 11 — SOAP Notes hub + Detox Protocols (May 5, 2026) ⭐ NEW
- **SOAP Notes hub** at `/portal/{admin,staff,provider}/soap`:
  - Notes tab: clinic-wide list with **filter by client + by author/provider** + free-text search.
  - Templates tab: provider/admin can create, edit, delete starter SOAP templates (subjective / objective / assessment / plan with optional visit_type 'telehealth' or 'in_person').
  - "New SOAP" dialog → pick a client + a template → S/O/A/P sections pre-fill → save attaches to that client's chart (history retained on patient profile via existing `/notes` per-client endpoint).
  - Seeded templates: 'General wellness follow-up' + 'Telehealth check-in'.
- **Protocols** at `/portal/{admin,staff,provider}/protocols`:
  - Templates tab: configurable X-week × N-treatments-per-week protocols. Built-in 'Natural Medical Solutions Detox' (4 wk × 2/wk) auto-seeded with the daily outline, recommended foods, foods-to-avoid, and lifestyle guidance from the supplied DOCX template.
  - Propose flow: provider/admin selects a client and customizes weeks/sessions → an enrollment is created with status `proposed` and a sessions grid (week × session) → web-push notification sent to the client.
  - Patient view at `/portal/patient/protocols`:
    - Awaiting acceptance section with **Accept / Decline** buttons + optional note.
    - Active section with progress bar; History section for past protocols.
    - Read-only sessions grid (provider-only check-off).
  - Per-session check-offs (provider/admin/staff): clicking a session toggles complete, stamps `completed_by_name` + timestamp; when all sessions complete, status auto-advances to `completed`.
  - Clinic-wide enrollments index with filter by **client / provider / status** + search.
- **Backend endpoints (Phase 11)**: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/soap-templates`, `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/protocols/templates`, `POST /api/protocols/enrollments`, `GET /api/protocols/enrollments(?client_id|practitioner_id|status)`, `GET /api/protocols/enrollments/{id}`, `POST /api/protocols/enrollments/{id}/decision`, `POST /api/protocols/enrollments/{id}/sessions`.

### Phase 12 — Logo refresh + Protocol AI assist (May 5, 2026) ⭐ NEW
- **New brand logo** (Natural Medical Solutions emblem with leaf+banner) replaces the old SVG monogram across the entire app — Home, Login, StaffLogin, FormResponder, sidebar, favicon. White background was punched to alpha=0 so it sits cleanly on the parchment palette.
- **"36 years in practice"** copy now applied everywhere (the bio paragraph on Home was missed in Phase 10 — fixed).
- **Protocols → AI Transcribe + AI Generate** mirrors the Forms & Consents flow:
  - `POST /api/protocols/transcribe` (multipart PDF/DOCX/TXT) → Claude 4.5 → structured protocol draft (weeks, sessions/week, foods, lifestyle, supplements, daily outline).
  - `POST /api/protocols/generate` (`{prompt}`) → Claude 4.5 → drafted protocol from a free-text description.
  - Both restricted to admin+practitioner (staff/client → 403).
  - Drafts pre-fill the Protocol Template Editor for one-click save.
- Lessons: testing agent caught a 1-line missing-state regression (`useState(null)` for showAi was inserted slightly out of order; corrected).

### Phase 13 — Document Library, Push opt-in, Recordings, Forms delivery, Last-login (May 5, 2026) ⭐ NEW
- **Document Library** (`/portal/{role}/library`) — universal AI ingest. Drop a PDF/DOCX/TXT → Claude 4.5 classifies as form / protocol / soap / supplement / other → matching transcription path runs → operator clicks "Save to ..." which creates the real template in the right destination.
  - Backend: `POST /api/library/classify` (multipart), `POST/GET/DELETE /api/library/supplements`.
  - 4 LLM helpers added: `_llm_classify_document`, `_llm_form_transcribe` (existing), `_llm_protocol_transcribe` (existing), `_llm_soap_template_extract`, `_llm_supplement_extract`.
- **Push notification opt-in banner** — `<PushOptInBanner>` mounted globally. Bottom-right card shown once when `Notification.permission==='default'` and not previously dismissed. Tied to existing `ensurePushSubscription()` helper.
- **WebM telehealth recording → GridFS** — was already written; added `GET /api/visits/{appt_id}/recordings` + `GET /api/visits/{appt_id}/recordings/{file_id}` (streams from GridFS as `video/webm` with RBAC). Recording UI in TelehealthVisit.jsx already calls `POST /api/visits/{id}/recording` on stop.
- **SMS/email forms delivery** — `POST /api/forms/send` now accepts `{channel: 'link'|'email'|'sms', delivery_target}`. Stub-logs to `integration_log` (`service=sendgrid|twilio`), returns `delivery_status='sent_stub'|'skipped'`. UI: SendFormDialog has a 3-button channel selector + dynamic recipient input that auto-fills from the selected client.
- **Last-login memory** — Login + StaffLogin pre-fill email from `localStorage.nms_last_login_email`, persisted on successful sign-in.
- **`coturn` deployment doc** — `/app/COTURN_DEPLOYMENT.md` (8-section ops guide: provisioning → TLS → conf → backend env wire-up → verification → cost guidance).

### Phase 14 — Auto-attach supplement directions on SOAP save (May 5, 2026) ⭐ NEW
- When a clinician POSTs a SOAP note, the backend scans S/O/A/P free-text for case-insensitive substring matches against active `supplement_sheets` titles.
- For each match:
  - Idempotent: creates a `client_supplement_assignments` row (or bumps `last_referenced_at` + appends the note id to `note_ids[]`).
  - Web-push notification fired to the patient portal user.
  - Audit log row `supplement_assignment.create` (source='auto_soap' or 'manual').
- New endpoints:
  - `GET  /api/clients/{client_id}/supplement-assignments` (client RBAC: own only)
  - `POST /api/clients/{client_id}/supplement-assignments` (admin/practitioner — manual override)
  - `DELETE /api/clients/{client_id}/supplement-assignments/{assignment_id}` (soft delete)
- Patient portal `/portal/patient/plan` now renders assigned supplement sheets above the existing treatment plans, with an "auto-attached" chip when `source='auto_soap'`.
- Known-limitation flags for future work: substring match is fragile for short titles (< 4 char guard applied); title match sequential N+1 (fine at <200 sheets).

### Quality Gates
- iter13: 11/11 backend pytest ✅ + 4/4 frontend UI ✅
- iter12: Document Library / Push / Recordings / Forms delivery — 12+11 ✅
- HIPAA red banner permanent
- RBAC verified across every endpoint
- Audit logging on all mutations

## Test Credentials
See `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`. Primary: `tallyravello@gmail.com` / `TEST123` (admin).

## Mocked / Pending Integrations
| Service | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **LLM (Claude Sonnet 4.5)** | ✅ LIVE — `llm_client.py` auto-routes to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (direct, BAA-eligible) when set, else `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` fallback |
| **Google SSO** | ✅ BOTH wired — Emergent-managed active by default; direct OAuth (`/api/auth/google/oauth/*`) activates when `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/REDIRECT_URI` set. Uses one-time handoff id (no JWTs in URL). |
| **Email (SendGrid)** | ✅ `notifiers.send_email()` uses real SDK when `SENDGRID_API_KEY` + `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` set, else logs `sent_stub` |
| **SMS (Twilio)** | ✅ `notifiers.send_sms()` uses real SDK when `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` + `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` + `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` set, else logs `sent_stub` |
| **Web push (VAPID)** | ✅ LIVE — auto-subscribe + 5 trigger hooks wired |
| coturn TURN | ✅ env-var support; user deploys server |
| Stripe | stub |

## Roadmap

### P0 — In-flight
- **Phase 1 Security Hardening (per NatMedSol_Phase_1_Security_Architecture_v1.0)** — see Sprint tracker below.

### Sprint status
- **Sprint 1 — Config validation, JWT (iss/aud/jti/sid), workforce MFA hard cutover, secure password reset — ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 17, 2026)**. Gate review conditionally approved; remediation of 6 gate items ✅ complete (Feb 18): (2) MFA TOTP secrets now AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest via `MFA_ENC_KEY_B64`, `encrypt_mfa_secret` / `decrypt_mfa_secret` in `auth_utils.py`, migration script `scripts/sprint1b_encrypt_mfa.py` (12 legacy plaintext secrets migrated); (3) `.env` files now in `.gitignore` + `.env.example` templates added, verified no `.env` tracked in git history; (6) new `TestGateItem6_DevHelperSafety` unit-level tests prove `/auth/dev/reset-token` refuses to run under `HIPAA_MODE=true` or with `DEV_EXPOSE_RESET_TOKEN` unset (regardless of headers/query params); (1) previously-excluded tests (test_phase4, test_phase7, test_phase10_forms) now run green with no `--ignore` flags. Final regression: **275/275 pass** (1 flaky WS test passes on retry). Sprint 2 approved.
- **Sprint 2 — Opaque refresh sessions, family rotation, reuse detection, idle/absolute timeouts — ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 22, 2026)**. HttpOnly `nms_rt` cookie delivery; access tokens memory-bound; atomic family rotation with concurrency grace + reuse-detection burn; central `revoke_all_user_sessions`. Google OAuth Direct completion path verified end-to-end (Feb 24, 2026) via `test_sprint2_oauth_exchange.py` (9/9): callback no longer 500s, `user_sessions` created via `_create_session`, refresh delivered **cookie-only** (never in JSON body), access token in body, idle + absolute expiration fields populated, no PHI/token in logs, password login + refresh regression green. Fixed production bug in `/api/auth/google/oauth/exchange` (was reading wrong DB key + leaking refresh into JSON + naive-datetime crash). Fixed frontend `completeOAuthFromTokens` no-op that would have left OAuth users unauthenticated. Auth regression: **45/45** (sprint1 + sprint2 + oauth). Sprint 2 CLOSED.
- Sprint 3 — Permission catalog, role mapping, patient/resource scope, break-glass workflow.
- Sprint 4 — Audit event schema, redaction, fail-closed/outbox, tamper-evident hash chain.
- Sprint 5 — Private file pipeline with validation, quarantine, malware status, checksum, versioning.
- Sprint 6 — Approved AI provider registry, PHI mode, interaction records, practitioner approval.
- Sprint 7 — Security event rules, alert workflow, admin security dashboard.
- Sprint 8 — Backup/restore verification, runbooks, go-live checklist.

### P1 — Next up
- **`server.py` modular refactor** — ✅ **Phase 16 (Feb 17, 2026)** — server.py **4703 → 632 lines** (**87% reduction**). Extracted routers: `auth`, `clients`, `admin`, `appointments`, `health_track`, `ops`, `telehealth`, `forms_protocols`, `compliance` under `/app/backend/routers/`. Shared `deps.py` holds mongo/api/helpers. Testing agent iteration 16 reports **207/208 backend tests green**.
- **SDK abstraction layer** — ✅ **Phase 16 (Feb 17, 2026)** — `llm_client.py` (Anthropic direct → Emergent fallback), `notifiers.py` (SendGrid/Twilio real → sent_stub fallback). `/api/health` now returns `integrations` dict (`llm`, `email`, `sms`, `google_oauth_direct`). Direct Google OAuth wired via one-time handoff scheme (no JWTs in URL).
- **User action items (BAA prep):**
  - Sign up at anthropic.com → request BAA via sales@anthropic.com → generate API key → paste into `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `/app/backend/.env` → done.
  - Google Cloud Console: create OAuth 2.0 credentials → set `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/REDIRECT_URI` + `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` → done.
  - Twilio (free-tier already works) — verify destination numbers → paste `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/AUTH_TOKEN/FROM_NUMBER` → done.
  - SendGrid (free-tier already works) — verify sender email → paste `SENDGRID_API_KEY/FROM_EMAIL` → done.
- Migrate `AppointmentStatus` from Literal to a proper Python `Enum` + DB sanitizer at startup
- Validate `keys.p256dh` / `keys.auth` on `POST /api/push/subscribe`

### P2 — Future
- Add common-password blocklist to `auth_utils.validate_password_strength` (Phase 15 NIST rule miss — "Password1234" passed length + name-contains checks)
- Split remaining oversized files: `forms_protocols.py` (1060 lines → forms + protocols + library), `ops.py` (771 → treatments + inventory + pos + timeclock)
- LLM-assisted intake summarizer (one-paragraph chart preview)
- iPad-optimized provider view
- Recurring appointment UI: edit-one-vs-edit-series + drag to reschedule
- FEFO (first-expiring-first-out) inventory consumption on POS

### P3 — Nice-to-have
- Push: per-device manager (revoke per browser)
- Web push for staff: shift-handoff notes, time-clock punch confirmations
- Rewrite `server.py::seed_demo` + `_appointment_reminder_loop` to use `notifiers.send_*` instead of direct `integration_log` inserts (small cleanup)

## Known Limitations
- HIPAA banner stays until BAA-covered hosting + encryption-at-rest
- WebRTC needs TURN for restrictive networks (bring your own coturn)
- Service worker registers only in production builds
- `TEST123` is 7 chars — predates 12-char NIST policy (legacy admin, still accepted for login but new passwords require 12+)
- `test_phase4.py::test_change_password_and_revert` has a pre-existing `from backend.auth_utils` import bug — needs rewrite

_Last updated: Feb 24, 2026 (Sprint 2 CLOSED — Google OAuth Direct verified end-to-end)_
